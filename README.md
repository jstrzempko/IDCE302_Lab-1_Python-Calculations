## Lab 1 â€“ Calculations with Python

The code in this script calculates agricultural land and rain runoff for a 1000 square foot agricultural plot in Kenya that receives a 1 inch rainfall. It was completed as Lab 1 Calculations with Python for the Clark University course IDCE 302 Python Programming taught by Professor Shadrock Roberts. 

Human development of agricultural land is resulting in an increase in impervious surfaces worldwide. Rainwater tends to runoff impermeable surfaces like paved roads more than agricultural lands. In Kenya, increased runoff can lead to both opportunities for resource reuse and the occurrence of disasters like flooding and landslides. This script provides runoff calculations that can be used to mitigate disasters and provide local populations opportunities to take advantage of the impacts of development. 

No major errors were encountered in the creation of this script.
